Now I understand there are some things that would be really bad to see in a gym locker room. Used needles. Weapons. Cameras. Roaches. But, I feel like those are too obvious. Too in-your-face. No, what I'm talking about is much worse.

Picture this...

You just finished up a workout (what a beast)(humble brag)(yeah I workout nbd). You slip into the locker room to grab your backpack. You quickly pass the sinks and vanities, where out of the corner of your eye you see 2 young men standing at the mirror. There's a phone propped up against the countertop while they flex shirtless for the camera.

This is common occurence at my local Esporta Fitness. Every time, I throw up in my mouth and do my best not to bully them. It blows my mind every single time. I don't know if they're taking photos or doing TikToks or something, but I just can't stand it. I get wanting to track your progress or admire your body cause you look like a Greek God–that needs to be done in the privacy of your own home.

I've always wanted to say "You know other people can see you right? You look like fucking losers," but I'm a scaredy cat.

I hope you're not reading this thinking "what's this guy's deal?" I feel like I would if I were you.

If the Jags lose to RusseLL WiLLLson and the Denver F****** Broncos, I will be in a hellscape. My body will be on fire with the most intense rage and depression. London is pretty much a home game for us. We are 2-5 ATS (against the spread, for those of you didn't graduate middle school), so I see this week as a regression to the mean–the Jags opened as 4-point favorites (already down to 2.5).
I will be in a dark, dark place if we do not win on Sunday.
