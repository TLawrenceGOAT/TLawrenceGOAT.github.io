There's currently still 14:52 left in the Raiders/Jaguars game, but I've already decided this blog will be about the incredible comeback win from the Jags. It's 24-20 right now, but it could be 38-20 by the time I'm done writing this. Trevor Lawrence has put me through an unhealthy range of emotions today, going from missing open receivers and fumbling away the ball on an easy pitch play to scrambling for first downs and finding Chrisitian Kirk in the endzone for 6. Whatever halftime snack he had this Sunday, he needs to eat it every day for the rest of his life.

The defense drove me crazy in the first half, giving up over 100 yards and 2 TDs to Davante Adams. Fortunately, they've been able to limit the passing game in the second half. They were also able to bottle up Josh Jacobs for most of the game. Andre Cisco missed an easy interception, but it's hard to get too upset about that when we are normally so bad that we couldn't stop a nosebleed.

With our 4-point lead, I can't stop thinking about the stat that announcers and talking heads won't let us forget: the Jaguars are 0-5 this season in 1-score games. As I watch TLaw lead the offense down into the redzone, I secretly hope we only wind up with a FG so that when we win this game, it'll only be 27-20 and we will be able to get that monkey off of our back (also I picked under 48 in my [Wednesday Wagers](./2022-11-02-wednesday-wagers-the-return.md)). Aaaaaaand, Riley Patterson just doinked a FG off the crossbar.

Ok, well I stopped writing after that missed FG because the game was in dire need of my attention. What a win! What a comeback! The Jags surmount a 17-0 deficit and win their first 1-score game of the season! Pop the champagne! Hang the banner!

Trevor's statline ended up pretty clean, as long as you count the fumble against JaMycal Hasty instead of Lawrence. I loved the scrambling and running ability that Trevor showed today. Lots of good to take away from his game, just need to button up the mistakes. I would normally turn off the TV if the Jags were to go down by 17 at any point in the game, but with Trevor I do find myself with a seemingly never-ending supply of hope.

When it came to crunchtime, the secondary tightened up and Dawuane Smoot came up with a clutch sack on 3rd down to force the Raiders to attempt a lateral play on the last play of the game. Usually, I wouldn't even put the words "Jaguars" and "clutch" in the same zip code, nevermind the same sentence. But today, the Jaguar defense came through in the clutch.

Don't let my optimism and joy confuse you. This team still sucks. There is a LOT of work to do on both sides of the ball. Trevor needs to develop more consistency and comfort. ETN needs to stop trying to bounce runs outside (Travis you aren't playing against the incredible athletes of Georgia Tech and Boston College anymore). Josh Allen and Travon Walker haven't been getting any pressure the past few weeks. ***But***, I believe this team is heading in the right direction. I've set my expectations for the rest of the season and think we will get to 6-11, which may not seem great but we have a tough second half schedule. Also, to you Negative Nancy's out there, that would be **double** (2x) the number of wins we had last year.

*P.S.* With Under 48 hitting in this game, my Wednesday Wagers are off to a 1-0-1 start. I am officially undefeated gambling on the NFL this year!
