Big news out of Indianapolis this afternoon, with the Colts firing Frank Reich in his 5th season as their Head Coach. Reich led the team to a 40-33 record over those 4.5 years, with 2 playoff berths. His first year coaching the Colts was Andrew Luck's last season before he embarrasingly retired in the prime of his career. That year they also started the season with only 3 wins through 9 weeks, yet finished 10-6 due to Luck's incredible arm.

After benching Matt "Old Yeller" Ryan for second-year QB Sam Ehlinger, their 3 wins through 9 weeks doesn't have the same optimistic hope that it did in 2018. All-Pros Jonathan Taylor and Shaq Leonard haven't been able to stay healthy this year, their offensive line has underperformed, and they have a paste-eater under center. Someone had to be the scapegoat and Jim Irsay decided Reich was the one to get the bullet.

Very shortly after announcing the firing, Irsay named long-time Colts center Jeff Saturday as interim HC. Most of the time when a head coach is removed from his position midseason, owners or general managers will give the interim opportunity to one of the coordinators, as a chance to either win the job or be a placeholder until the offseason where a formal coaching search can be executed. Irsay decided to hire someone from outside the organization—someone with zero NFL coaching experience—to fulfill this temporary role. As a Jags fan, I love this decision.

In his press conference about the new hire, Irsay said "I don't know how to make sausage. I don't know what goes into sausage. But I do know how to build a football team." It's hard to disagree with the man, as the Colts have enjoyed plenty of success this millenium on the backs of Peyton Manning and Andrew Luck.

With pretty much nothing to look forward to in the Indy QB room, I think it's time they trade away all of their major pieces for draft capital and start the rebuild. From an unbiased perspective, I think most people would agree they are not in a "Win Now" window and in such a QB-centric league, they need to find their guy in the draft. CJ Stroud and Bryce Young will likely both declare for the 2023 NFL Draft, so don't be surprised if this Jeff Saturday hire turns out to be Irsay's way of tanking to get a higher draft pick.

It would be such a shame if the Colts assumed the bottom position in the AFC South that the Jaguars have held on to so tightly over the years. Such a shame.
