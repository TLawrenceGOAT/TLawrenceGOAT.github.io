Tom Brady does NOT look like himself out there. For the first time in 20 years, he looks like a mortal being. The Bucs are 3-5, which is Tom's worst record through 8 games in his career. You have to wonder what's going on? Yeah he's 45, his teammates have struggled to stay healthy, but there's more to this story.

He's been missing passes very uncharacteristic of him and lacking any magic in clutch moments. Is there a body double out there playing in his place? Is the botox poisoning his brain? Did he accidentally eat a strawberry(look up the TB12 diet, I'm not finding the link for you dumbass)? Now these are all viable theories, but they're just theories. I know the real reason Tom looks like Matt Schaub.

After Gisele took the kids and left, Tom fell apart. He is now just a shell of the man he once was. Not only does he miss his international supermodel wife:

But he's also struggling to find joy in life without his kids to kiss on the lips. He badly needs to be reunited with his family.

There are rumors swirling the Internet that he's playing poorly purposefully(say that 3 times fast) in order to send some sort of message to Gisele that he's willing to do anything to make their marriage work, even lose at footballâ€“the thing he hates most in the world. Personally, I just think he's so busy crying to Taylor Swift in a dark room all day that he doesn't have time to watch film. Maybe he's starting having a couple beers at night to numb the pain and is losing a step physically. Potentially, he's finally fell off the cliff that people have been predicting he'd fall off of for the past 7 years.

Whatever it is, it's incredibly ugly to watch and I hate having it shoved down my throat on Thursday Night Football. Tom, please put us all out of our misery and re-retire.
