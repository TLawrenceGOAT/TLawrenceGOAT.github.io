Thank you for finding my new blog BlogGOAT! This will be a interesting adventure for both you and me--I have no idea how to build a website or write a blog, but here I am attempting to do both. The main topic I'm looking to cover on here is sports, although who knows what this will become. There's a nonzero chance this is the only blog posted on this site (credit to me for knowing myself).

Currently, I'm in the last row, middle seat of a Frontier flight from Cincinnati to Orlando. For the first time in my life, I see why people refuse to fly with airlines like Frontier and Spirit.

`1` They made everyone stuff their personal items into one of those metal box stands to verify it fit the measurement requirements--$90 to purchase a carry-on if it didn't. One of the guys behind me was going to bite the flight attendant's head off cause he was basically forced to pay $90 to carry  on the same bag he's flown with as a personal item for years.

`2` The entire crew seems like they hate their jobs. Now I'll cut them some slack because I would too if I were them, but it's killing the vibe on the plane.

`3` Obviously, I have no leg or shoulder room. How much smaller are seats on here than on a flight with an airline like Delta or JetBlue? I bet they have it nice over there.

`4` The guy sitting next to me has clearly been drinking and is playing games with the young kids sitting across the aisle from us. He saw I was playing Madden Mobile on my phone, asked how to download it, and proceeded to fumble his way to their website on his phone before giving up because he got lost. Seems like a nicy guy, though.

`5` I forgot to charge my Beats.

`6` These seats make me feel like I'm serving life in prison.

Anyways, I'm going to the Clemson @ FSU CFB game Saturday. Doak will be rocking, take FSU plus the points in a primetime matchup as the former powerhouse begins its reascent to glory. I hope Jordan Travis is healthy and I hope their 7' WR eats his Wheaties.

This was fun, thank you for reading. We should do this again soon!
