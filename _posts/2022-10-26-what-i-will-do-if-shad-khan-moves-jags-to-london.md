It’s a cool, overcast day in Trafalgar Square. The cold front just started moving in 2 nights ago. Nevertheless, passersby have not let the unfriendly weather infect their spirits. A woman pushes a swaddled baby in a stroller, smiling at the little guy all the while to my left. To my right, a rightly gang of hometown lads jostle and jorble around, laughing about the good ole days in Dartfordshire. In front of me, an older gentleman adjusts his glasses which have a habit of falling crooked on his head. He’s eating a bagel and sipping on something warm, just observing the people who have come to this famous part of London to enjoy their Tuesday morning. 

I am also in Trafalgar Square. I am not enjoying myself. In fact, while all of this joviality is happening around me, I stand there with a lit match. You are probably wondering, and the answer is yes. I am about to burn London to the ground. 

Let me be clear. This is not my fault at all. I take no responsibility for my words or actions. This is Mr. Shad Khan’s doing. He lied to the great people of Jacksonville in 2021, when he said with “100% certainty” that he would not move the Jags. I can forgive a bad team. I can forgive abject incompetence when it comes to assembling any kind of respectable football organization. I can even forgive us signing Nick Foles for $90 million. When the Jags signed Foles, I simply decided to be a man and only worry about the things I can control. On the inside, I was crying like a little bitch! Nick Foles is terrible! I persisted in the face of that travesty. But I cannot and will not forgive him moving my beloved Jags to the land of the redcoats. I am not strong enough for that kind trauma.

You might think this is an overreaction. You might think this is not even an effective strategy to get the Jags back. At this point, I am not operating according to any kind of logic. I am a man of delusional and hopeless passion, one of the few pre-reqs for being a Jags fan in the first plan. 

If Shad Khan moves the Jags, I will burn the city of London to the ground.
