It is my pleasure to announce the long-awaited return of Wednesday Wagers. For those of you who didn't have the pleasure of tailing my picks last NFL season, Wednesday Wagers was my weekly NFL gambling blog over at SportsHosts.com. It was actually because of the few months I spent with SportsHosts that I got into blogging in the first place. Sadly, they went bankrupt sometime between January and now, so those blogs–much like Aaron Hernandez–are gone forever.

That makes this a great opportunity for a fresh start. Every* Wednesday, I will provide you with my 5 best NFL picks of the week. I GUARANTEE** you will make money if you follow me play by play. All wagers will be backed by my computer model that only looks at the deepest of numbers and sharpest of trends.

I am giving out these 4 of these picks free of charge. However, if you would like access to my __Whale Play Lock Of The Week__, sponsored by Lizzo, you will first have to share this blog with a friend. This is my absolute best bet of the week and is sure to have you retiring before 30.

### Pick #1
__Jaguars/Raiders u48__
Both of these teams suck. Unless you are a Raiders or Jaguars fan (god bless your soul) or some kind of sicko, you have no excuse to watch this toilet bowl. Unders are 71-51-1 this season. You do the math there. Place the bet and forget. You will thank me later.

### Pick #2
__Rams/Bucs u42.5__
Two sad stories going on with these teams. The older generation of QBs are falling off cliffs right before our eyes. Their unders are 2-5 and 2-6, respectively, in Rams' and Bucs' games this season. Again, unders as a whole are 71-51-1 this season and it's largely due to both of these geriatrics that have lost their fastballs. Additionally, these are 2 top-10 defenses, with an average combined score of 38.1 total points scored in their collective games this season. Matt and Tom should both retire while they can still walk.

### Pick #3
__Chiefs/Titans o46.5__
Ladies and gentlemen, it is Tractorcito season. Derrick Henry just had his 6th career 200-yard, 2-TD rushing game (his 4th against the Texans). Only 3 other people have 3 or more of these: LaDainian Tomlinson, Barry Sanders, and Jim Brown; they all have 3. Mean while, Patrick Mahomes has been building chemsitry with his new WRs Juju Smith-Schuster and Marques Valdes-Scantling (typing that out made me realize how unique both of their names are) under the safety blanket of Future HoFer Travis Kelce. This game screams points.

### Pick #4
__Ravens -2.5__
It's getting a bit late. This one is a total gut pick. I love watching Lamar play football. I'm trying to picture Andy Dalton leading the Saints to a victory over these Ravens but even in my head he's throwing interceptions to linebackers over the middle of the field and getting slammed to the ground by Calais Campbell 3+ times.

### WHALE PLAY LOCK OF THE WEEK
**__Falcons +3__**
I haven't seen anything I like from the Chargers this season. Herbert might still be hurt or injured, and they've been without Keenan Allen for a while now. But this pick is more about the fact that the NFC South Division Leader Atlanta Falcons are 6-2 ATS this season. I saw Kyle Pitts catch a touchdown this past weekend and boy was I impressed. Cordarrelle Patterson will most likely be back (hopefully). Also, they are 3-0 ATS this season as home underdogs. Underdogs are 68-51-4 ATS this season. This is an automatic win. Free money.
