I've always found it difficult to understand why people in abusive or toxic relationships struggle to leave those relationships. It never made any sense. If your significant other treats you like shit, makes you unhappy more than they make you happy, or simply has no regard for your feelings, remove that person from your life and don't look back. You'll be better off.

The most obvious form of abuse is physical. Please call 800-799-7233 if you experience any form of domestic violence. The lesser known form of abuse comes in a much more nuanced manner. After doing some [research](https://www.newportinstitute.com/resources/co-occurring-disorders/how-to-know-abusive-relationship/), I found that there are 4 categories of emotionally abusive behavior:

>Humiliation: insulting, criticizing, name-calling, embarrassing the other person in public, belittling their accomplishments, posting unflattering photos or videos of them on social media
>Control: acting jealous and possessive, monitoring the other person’s behavior, reading their texts and emails, demanding all their time and attention, pressuring them to use drugs or alcohol, using social media to track their activities, trying to control who they follow on social media
>Blaming and gaslighting: accusing the other person of cheating, denying abusive behavior or blaming it on the victim, claiming their problems are the other person’s fault
>Neglect and isolation: refusing to communicate, turning other people against the victim, withholding affection, preventing the other person from seeing friends or family

If you experience even one of these, seek help from family and friends. Thanks to the Newport Institute, we know 10 signs that might give someone more specific examples of emotional abuse to look for in their own relationship.

>1. You don’t feel free to make your own choices.
>2. You’re always apologizing.
>3. You don’t talk about the relationship with friends or family.
>4. Your partner “love bombs” you.
>5. You feel like everything that’s wrong with the relationship is your fault.
>6. Your disagreements turn into screaming fights.
>7. You never know which version of your partner you’re going to get.
>8. You get shut down when you try to communicate.
>9. You’ve lost confidence in your own perspective.
>10. You’ve forgotten what you used to be like before the relationship.

For me, I've found that the Newport Institute hits the nail on the head with a few of these. They've awoken me to the realization that I, myself, am in an abusive relationship. My relationship takes on a bit of a different form—since my childhood, I was raised to unconditionally love the Jacksonville Jaguars. We've had our ups and downs (mostly downs), but I have always taken the blame for the faults. Recently, with the help of friends and family I've been able to see certain signs that appear on the list above.

##### #1 You don't feel free to make your own choices.
Every Sunday at 1:00 PM (The NFL wouldn't dare put us on primetime more than once per year), I feel a compulsion to sit down on my couch and watch the Jaguars play. Because they aren't good enough to be on national TV, my Jaguars coax me to commit crimes by illegally streaming the game from some sketchy website.

##### #4 Your partner "love bombs" you.
Take me back to 2017. That season is the closest I will ever be to a Super Bowl ring. Somehow, my Jags bottled lightning in 2017. This "love bomb" made me realize why I tolerate the constant pain of being a Jags fan. With the best defense in NFL history and the BOAT, we couldn't be stopped by anybody (except that stupid fucking referee who blew the whistle after Myles Jack forced and recovered a fumble which would've been returned for a touchdown).

##### #7 You never know which version of your partner you're going to get.
Every so often, the Jaguars will fuck around and pretend to be a competent team for a week. Whether it's the 38-10 demolition of the Chargers this year, the 9-6 victory over Josh Allen's Bills last year, or the 27-20 win over the Colts in 2020 to start the season 1-0 (only to be followed by 20 straight losses). This year has been especially bad as Trevor Lawrence looks like Patrick Mahomes on some plays and Matt Ryan (current Matt Ryan) on others.

I am in an abusive relationship with the Jacksonville Jaguars. Consider this my cry for help.
