Welcome back to another week of Wednesday Wagers, where I give out nothing but winners and the haters can’t stand it. I would like to invite those of you who doubted my picks to promptly fuck right off and never return.

Now that we got that out of the way, let’s recap last week’s dominance quickly and get onto the next round of money-making, beat-the-S&P500, refinance-your-mortgage-to-bet-more picks.

The Raiders/Jaguars game fell under by 1, no thanks to Trevor Lawrence’s incredibly efficient outing. Josh McDaniels has now blown three 17-point-leads this season, doing his best Super Bowl 51 Dan Quinn impression. The Raiders don't get enough credit for how much they've underachieved so far.

Anyone with eyeballs and at least 2 brain cells to rub together saw that Rams/Bucs toilet bowl coming from a mile away. Aside from a 69 *(nice)* yard TD to Cooper Kupp, Matthew Stafford couldn't get much going, while Brady's leading receiver was Cade Otton–kudos to you if you already knew who that is, I sure didn't.

If you only watched the first 1/3 of the Chiefs/Titans game, you probably would've figured it was going Over without a doubt. With 5 minutes left in the first half, the Titans scored to make it a 14-9 ball game. Luckily, I didn't stay up long enough to watch my beautiful Sunday Night Footbal Over die a slow death right before my eyes. Can't win 'em all.

The Ravens dominated the Saints from start to finish, firmly tossing their metaphorical hats into the Contenders Ring. They ran the damn ball with authority and played stout defense against a struggling Saints team. Another easy winner.

Now, we get to the bad beat of the week. With under a minute left in the game, the Chargers and Falcons were all tied up at 17. Justin Herbert had dinked-and-dunked his offense down inside the Falcons' 25, and then this happened:

No more needs to be said about that, so let's move on to Week 10!

##### Record

| Last Week | Season |
| :---: | :---: |
| 3-1-1 | 3-1-1 |

### Pick #1

***Giants -4.5***

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Got an email this morning naming Brian Daboll the second-most handsome coach behind only Kliff Kingsbury. It’s according to beauty-technology analysis and <a href="https://t.co/Gz7h70ZL48">https://t.co/Gz7h70ZL48</a> using the Golden Ratio Face app. <br><br>This is why you guys need me.

When I think about the Giants, all I can see is Brian Daboll's shiny bald head and enormous belly. That man knows how to coach a football even better than he knows how to crush a Big Mac. He's definitely in the running for Coach of the Year, leading the New York Football Giants to a 6-2 record. When I think about the Texans, all I can see is Davis Mills' long, skinny neck and terrible arm. That man does not know how to play quarterback in the NFL. Dameon Pierce has been tough to tackle, but that won't be enough to keep this one competitive. Giants by a $Milly$.

### Pick #2

***Browns/Dolphins u48.5***

Unders are red hot this season, which might explain why it feels like this NFL season has been a little underwhelming so far. This season, in games where the total is greater than 47.5, the Under is 20-11 (65%). Kevin Stefanski's gonna try to keep Tua and Tyreek off the field by running the ball with Nick Chubb every chance he gets. I like Myles Garrett to get pressure on Tua and slow that speedy Miami offense down a bit. No one likes rooting for the Under, but everyone loves cashing bets. Take your medicine and thank me in the morning when you can retire yesterday.

### Pick #3

***Vikings/Bills u44***

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1PM Kirk Cousins is iced out<br> <a href="https://t.co/ADlp0TRxkw">pic.twitter.com/ADlp0TRxkw</a></p>&mdash; Barstool Sports (@barstoolsports) <a href="https://twitter.com/barstoolsports/status/1589406879587106817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Unders. Are. Hot. No one wants to bet them and Vegas is raking in the cash this year with all of the [fools who put their money on Primetime Overs](https://tlawrencegoat.github.io/wednesday-wagers-the-return#h-pick-3). These two teams combine for an Under record of 12-4 this season. Josh Allen might not play, but even if he does he will not be his normal self due to the elbow injury he sustained against the Jets last week. This will be a huge test for Kirk Cousins. Although the Vikings are 7-1, their 1 loss came against the only above-average team they played–the Philadelphia Eagles. My inside sources lead me to believe that Josh Allen won't suit up for this one, so ride the Under with me in Buffalo.

### Pick #4

***Colts/Raiders u42.5***

Gonna keep saying it until it's not true–Unders are red hot. In this week's toilet bowl, we have never-coached-professionally Jeff Saturday and never-quarterbacked-successfully Sam Ehlinger up against always-fucking-something-up Josh McDaniels and always-slowing-something-down Maxx Crosby. I would be shocked if Jeff arrives in Las Vegas at the correct time, let alone figures out how to get the Colts offense to score points. Davante Adams and Josh Jacobs will likely have a field day, but they won't score 40 on their own. Let me know down in the comments what you would rather do than watch this game.

I'm so sorry I gave out 3 unders this week, but the deep numbers speak for themselves.

### WHALE PLAY LOCK OF THE WEEK

***Seahawks +2.5***

This line stinks. How can the Tampa Bay Divorcees be favored over Geno "The Chosen One" Smith and the Seattle Seahawks? Vegas is begging you to take the Seahawks, which obviously makes me think the Bucs are the real play, but I physically can't make myself do it. This year, Seattle is 5-2 ATS as an underdog and Tampa is 2-6-1 ATS as a favorite. The market is yet to correct itself when it comes to these 2 teams and we're gonna take advantage while that lasts. Pete Carroll is another who has his team blowing expectations out of the water and will likely be Brian Daboll's biggest competitor for Coach of the Year. Seahawks continue to roll in Germany.
