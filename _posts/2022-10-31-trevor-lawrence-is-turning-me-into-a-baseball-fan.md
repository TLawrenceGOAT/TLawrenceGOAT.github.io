Well, if you read the ~unrelated tangent~ of [one of my previous blogs](./2022-10-27-why-tom-brady-playing-like-trash.md) you may know that football and I have had a rather complicated relationship recently. I truly believed the Jacksonville Jaguars had left behind the years and years (and years) of terrible football after a dominating Week 3 win over the LA Chargers.

<div align="center"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If we hold on to this big juicy W, I will be fully committed to believing. <a href="https://t.co/2R9YKDGKyk">https://t.co/2R9YKDGKyk</a></p>&mdash; future AFC south champ (@TLawrenceGOAT) <a href="https://twitter.com/TLawrenceGOAT/status/1574153884494450689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>

Oh boy, did the Jags have me believing.

<div align="center"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Trevor Lawrence is Good.</p>&mdash; Big Cat (@BarstoolBigCat) <a href="https://twitter.com/BarstoolBigCat/status/1574168030359457792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>

Sitting at 2-1, with our 2nd year QB looking like he was making massive strides in his development–they had me hook, line, and sinker.

Five weeks later, I'm even more down on this team than last year. I had a real conversation with [@bortlesgoat5](https://twitter.com/bortlesgoat5) where we discussed that we had both taken the "Trevor Lawrence Isn't The Guy" panic button out of its hidden location and placed it on the countertop. I hadn't yet looked at it and it was still sitting with its cover firmly secured. [@bortlesgoat5](https://twitter.com/bortlesgoat5) wasn't as optimistic:

<div align="center"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m officially starting to familiarize myself with college QB prospects <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/firebaalke?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#firebaalke</a></p>&mdash; Jacksonville Johnny (@bortlesgoat5) <a href="https://twitter.com/bortlesgoat5/status/1586785393118175233?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 30, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>

He has glanced at the panic button several times, though thankfully has not removed it from its cardboard box. Jaguars fans might be sad to hear that he has unfortunately located the knife that he will use to open said box. The rest of Jaguars Twitter seems just as pessimistic.

With our season all but over, I have no choice but to turn to other teams and sports for entertainment. I've never considered myself a baseball fan, in fact I've hated watching baseball for a majority of my life. The sad quarterback play from Trevor Lawrence has made room in my heart for America's Pasttime, as I've found myself watching these MLB Playoffs over some PrimeTime NFL games–granted, there were some REALLY shitty matchups:

<div align="center"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Good news: the Thursday Night football game between the Colts and Broncos is over.<a href="https://t.co/Zz9IsV7mBT">https://t.co/Zz9IsV7mBT</a> <a href="https://t.co/4Isb5UvqkO">pic.twitter.com/4Isb5UvqkO</a></p>&mdash; The Athletic (@TheAthletic) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheAthletic/status/1578230580680036352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 7, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>

<div align="center"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Summing up Commanders-Bears Thursday Night Football... <a href="https://t.co/KXfQL6E7Zs">pic.twitter.com/KXfQL6E7Zs</a></p>&mdash; The Athletic (@TheAthletic) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheAthletic/status/1580734968950816768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 14, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>

Plus the 3 other times the NFL forced us to watch Russell Wilson and the god-awful Denver Broncos.

Meanwhile, I've loved watching baseball with no dog in the fight. No one to break my heart. No one to crush my soul and spit on my dead body. It's a place where no one can hurt me.

That could all change now that I've invested emotion in the Phillies winning the World Series over the Houston Trashtros. I'm gonna leave you all with this incredible video that–if you aren't a robot–will bring a tear to your eye.
